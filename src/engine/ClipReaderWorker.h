// Owns the ClipReaders for one media path on a dedicated thread; all decode calls are serialized
// here. Readers keep their own frame caches, so this class holds no cache of its own.
//
// There is one reader per stream id rather than one per path. A ClipReader carries a decode
// position, and both its audio and video fast paths assume the next request continues where the
// last one left off. Two clips cut from the same file and overlapping on the timeline break that
// assumption: they interleave requests at positions seconds apart. On the audio side the reader
// then served the second clip the first one's stream outright; on the video side it stayed correct
// but paid a keyframe seek and a GOP decode per frame, for every frame of the overlap.
